Anger tumbling and surging upwards, Hang Qing unceremoniously slammed the phone at Mu Ze, contented to hide without hiding, suffering for life. With a "pop", there were red marks on his face, and even slightly swollen, which looked a little ridiculous.
Su Rui shrank, a little afraid that Mu Ze would let out fire. But the fact is that Mu Ze just raised his hand and wiped his cheek nonchalantly, and smiled at Hang Qing: "Is this bad?"
"Who asked you to do this?" If my villain's favorability drops, are you responsible?
"I am willing to do this for you." Mu Ze smiled slightly, with an expression of no regrets and no regrets on his face.
Su Rui was dazed, raised her finger and pointed at Muze: "You... Coach Mu, you are to the senior..."
Hang Qing frowned unhappily. He hated to dismantle other people’s official staff. Mu Ze’s words made him feel like a third party stepped in, especially when he was in front of the heroine Su Rui. It's hard to accept.
